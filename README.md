Assignment: Junior Data Engineer- Web Scraping

* Research and Analysis
"In my work with Python Scrapy, I conducted thorough research and analysis to identify target websites, understand their structures,
and determine the best strategies for extracting relevant data. This involved studying the HTML and JavaScript elements of web pages,
analyzing their DOM structures, and exploring potential challenges such as dynamic content loading or anti-scraping mechanisms.
My research ensured that we could efficiently and accurately gather the required data."


* Logic Implementation in Code to Increase Coverage
"I implemented robust logic within Scrapy spiders to maximize data extraction coverage. This included exception handling various dropdown
and different content formats. By writing comprehensive and adaptable spiders, I ensured that we could scrape data from multiple sections
of target websites, thereby increasing the coverage and completeness of our datasets."

* Exception Handling and Code Optimization
"I emphasized exception handling and code optimization to enhance the reliability and performance of our Scrapy spiders. I implemented
try-except blocks to handle unexpected issues such as missing elements or connectivity problems. Additionally, I optimized the spiders
by using requests library, limiting the number of concurrent requests to avoid IP bans, and utilizing caching mechanisms to reduce
redundant data fetching."


* Documentation Coverage
"I prioritized thorough documentation to ensure our Scrapy projects were easily understandable and maintainable. This included writing
detailed comments within the spiders, Proper documentation facilitated better collaboration among team members and provided a
valuable resource for onboarding new developers."


* Data Modeling for the Final Data Storage
"I designed and implemented effective data models for storing scraped data. This involved defining item classes in Scrapy to structure
the data, selecting appropriate storage solutions such as file format, and ensuring data integrity and normalization. My
data modeling efforts provided a solid foundation for our data processing and analysis pipelines."


* Enabling/Implementing Fast Searching in the Final Data Storage
NA (Not use database)


Code Quality - Linting
I have done unit test for funtion that is taken in main.py file than extract data for one survey number table.


Note :- I have developed script for the given domain url by keeping mind above points.
